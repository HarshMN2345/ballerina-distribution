# Directory listener

The `file` library provides a`Directory Listener`, which is used to listen to the given directory in the local file system.
It notifies when new files are created in the directory or when the existing files are deleted or modified.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [File module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/file/latest/).
