# Tuples

The tuple type is another structured type supported by Ballerina, which creates a list of values like arrays. The main difference between arrays and tuples is that an array has only one type applicable to every member of its list. In contrast, in a tuple type, you can individually specify the types for each member. Tuples are most suitable for describing lists with multiple types.
